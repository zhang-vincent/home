		<h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The Eiffel Tower was built in the year 1889 by entrepreneur Gustave Eiffel, and engineers Maurice
			Koechlin and Emile Nouguier. Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier were both chief engineers in
			Eiffel's company: &ldquo;Compagnie des &Eacute;tablissements Eiffel.&rdquo;
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			The tower was initially disliked because of its design. It was even called &ldquo;the
			ugliest building in Paris,&rdquo; but over time, the pylon-shaped structure became a well-known landmark
			famous all around the world. The tower is a metal structure that stretches for 300 meters in height.
			The purpose of the structure was to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. 
			It was introduced to the world as the dominant showcase in the 1889 World Fair.
		</p>

		<h2>Height Competition</h2>
		<p>
			During the construction of the Eiffel Tower, it became the highest structure in the world as it passed
			the Washington Monument. It remained the highest building until 1930 when the Chrysler Building
			finished construction. Later, when the tower was used for radio broadcasts, a broadcasting aerial was
			added to the top of the tower in 1957, becoming 5.2 meters taller than the Chrysler Building. You can
			visit this landmark in Paris, France.
