		<h1>Niagara Falls</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Niagara Falls is a combined name of three waterfalls located at the border of Ontario, Canada and New York, United States of America. 
			The largest of the three falls is &ldquo;Horseshoe Falls&rdquo;, the second largest waterfall is &ldquo;American Falls&rdquo;, and 
			the smallest is &ldquo;Bridal Veil Falls&rdquo;.
		</p>

		<h3>Horseshoe Falls</h3>
		<p>
			Horseshoe Falls is the largest out of the three falls. This is because of about 90% of the water that flows down from the Niagara River
			passes through Horseshoe Falls. Horseshoe Falls source from Lake Erie and flows to Lake Ontario. It has a 90&deg; drop for 51 meters
			to the Lower Niagara River.
		</p>

		<h4>Hydroelectricity</h4>
		<p>
			Horseshoe Falls is currently used for hydroelectric power generation. It first began as a very small hydroelectric generation plant of
			only 2200 kilowatt in the year 1893. The power station was named Niagara Falls & River Railway Power House in 1893. The station was then
			named Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations in 1950 which was as large as a 2 million kilowatt power plant. There consists of 2
			generating stations in the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations. Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Station I and Sir Adam
			Beck Hydroelectric Generating Station II.
