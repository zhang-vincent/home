		<h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The Eiffel Tower was built in the year 1889 by entrepreneur Gustave Eiffel, and engineers Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier.
			Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier were both chief engineers in Eiffel's company: Compagnie des &Eacute;tablissements Eiffel. It is
			located in Paris, France.
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			In the beginning, the tower received many negative words because of its design. It was even called "the ugliest building in Paris",
			but over time the pylon shaped structure turned into a world-known landmark. The tower is a metal structure shaped like a pylon
			that stretches for 300 meters in the sky. The purpose of the structure was to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French
			Revolution. It was the dominant showcase in the 1889 world fair.
		</p>

		<h2>Height Competition</h2>
		<p>
			During the construction of the Eiffel Tower, it became the highest structure in the world as it passed the Washinton Monument.
			It remained the highest until 1930 when the Crysler Building finished construction. Later, when the tower was used for radio broadcast, 
			a broadcasting aerial was added to the top of the tower in 1957 becoming 5.2 meters taller than the Crysler Building.
