		<h1>St. Basil&rsquo;s Cathedral</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			St. Basil's Cathedral is located on the southern end of the Red Square in Moscow, Russia. It has
			many different colors, shapes, and patterns designed in a style that is unique to the Russian
			Culture. It is close to the world-known Kremlin which is also around the Red Square.
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			The cathedral was built by Ivan Vasilyevich who was nicknamed "Ivan the Terrible". The construction
			of the cathedral was ordered in 1554 to honor a military victory. Ivan's armies defeated the 
			independent Tatar khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan in the 1550s. Today the cathedral serves as a 
			landmark in Moscow, Russia.
