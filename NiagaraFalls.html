		<h1>Niagara Falls</h1>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Niagara Falls is the combined name of three waterfalls located at the border of Canada and United 
			States of America. The largest of the three falls is Horseshoe Falls, the second largest waterfall
			is American Falls, and the smallest is Bridal Veil Falls.
		</p>

		<h3>Horseshoe Falls</h3>
		<p>
			Horseshoe Falls is the largest out of the three falls. This is because of about 90% of the water
			that flows down from the Niagara River passes through Horseshoe Falls. The fall source from Lake
			Erie and flows to Lake Ontario. It has a 90&deg; drop, 51 meters down to the Lower Niagara River.
		</p>

		<h4>Hydroelectricity</h4>
		<p>
			Horseshoe Falls is currently used to generate hydroelectric power. It first began as a very
			small hydroelectric generation plant of only 2200 kilowatts in the year 1893. The power station
			was named Niagara Falls and later River Railway Power House in 1893. The station was then named
			Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations in 1950 which was then became a 2 million
			kilowatt power plant. There consists of 2 generating stations in the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric
			Generating Stations: Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Station I and Sir Adam Beck
			Hydroelectric Generating Station II.
