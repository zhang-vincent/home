		<h1>Great Wall of China</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The Great Wall of China was built over a long period of time. The building of the wall
			started as early as 7th century BC and the majority of the wall was built during the Ming
			Dynasty which was from 1368â€“1644. Many segments of the wall are parallel to each other in
			the northern section of China. The total distance of the Great Wall is 21196.18 kilometers
			and it took 2 500 years to complete.
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			In the beginning, it was used as a fortification against provinces but later, more segments
			of the wall were built in northern China to prevent invasions coming in that direction.
