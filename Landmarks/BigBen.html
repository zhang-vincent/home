		<h1>Big Ben</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The Elizabeth Tower is located on the north side of the Houses of Parliment which is in London, England. 
			It is designed by Sir Edmund Beckett Denison and Lord Grimthorpe in association with Sir George Airy and 
			the clockmaker Edward Dent. The tower is Known for its precision of time. It has rarely stopped, even 
			after a bomb destroyed the Commons Chamber, it was still standing and striking every hour.
		</p>

		<h2>Naming</h2>
		<p>
			The name Big Ben may seem like the name of the tower but in reality, Big Ben refers to the bell inside the
			tower called Elizabeth Tower.  Its original name was simply Clock Tower but then it was named to Elizabeth
			Tower for the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012.
