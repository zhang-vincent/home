		<h1>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known simply as the campanile or bell tower. The Italian name of this 
			landmark is Torre pendente di Pisa, and it stands in the Town of Pisa in Italy. It is known worldwide
			for its unintended tilt of about 4 degrees today. It is one of the 4 structures in the Cathedral
			Complex being the third structure in the complex.
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			Construction began on August 9, 1173, which was originally designed as a bell tower. It stood straight
			for about 5 years. In 1178, the third floor was completed and the tower began to lean because of the 
			uneven soil foundation. One side was clay mixture and the other was soil. It turned out that clay 
			mixture could not support the 14500-ton tower as much as soil. The construction stopped for 100 years
			because the Government wanted to see if the soil would become strong enough to support the weight. The
			construction again in 1272 which added 4 floors to the tower. In 1284, the war stopped the construction
			, and the 7th floor was added in 1319 and the bell chamber, in 1372. Later in 1964, the structure was 
			stabilized from the slanting with counterweights weighing a total of 800 tones.
