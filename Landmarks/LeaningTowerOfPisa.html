		<h1>Leaning Tower of Pisa</h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known simply as the Campanile or Bell Tower. The Italian
			name of this landmark is &ldquo;Torre pendente di Pisa&rdquo;, and it stands in the town of Pisa in
			Italy. It is known worldwide for its unintended tilt of about 4 degrees. It is one of the 4 structures
			in the Cathedral Complex being the third structure which finished construction in the complex.
		</p>

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			Construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began on August 9, 1173, which was originally designed
			as a bell tower. It stood straight for about 5 years. Then, in 1178, the third floor was completed
			and the tower began to lean because of the uneven soil foundation. One side of the ground was
			made of clay and the other was made of soil. It turned out that the clay mixture could not support
			the 14500-ton tower as much as soil could. The construction stopped for 100 years because the 
			government wanted to see if the soil would become strong enough to support the weight. Construction
			began again in 1272, and 4 floors were added to the tower. In 1284, the war stopped construction
			once again, the 7th floor was added in 1319 and the bell chamber, in 1372. In 1964, the structure
			was stabilized from the slanting with counterweights weighing a total of 800 tones.
